# Numerical Gabor Frames

This code provides different methods for estimating the frame set and frame bounds for Gabor frames. 

The code was written as part of our Bachelor's thesis. Detailed documentation can be found in the thesis in the Numerical Analysis chapter.

The file `setup.jl` can be run to install all needed Julia depedencies. The `modules` folder contains different methods as Julia modules and the `scripts` folder calls the methods and generates the plots that we use in our thesis.
